# Alien-Invasion
Phaser2 Modulair project.

08-march-2018

Alien Invasion is my first attempt at creating a game with Phaser2.

It is based on the Space Invaders theme.

Mostly I have created this project to learn how to create a complex project with Phaser2.


Working version:

Dutch:      https://www.pleisterman.nl/phaser/alienInvasion.php
English:    https://www.pleisterman.nl/phaser/alienInvasion.php?lang=en


What is implemented?

Scenes:
    Splashscreen.
    Menu with options:
        Start.
        Highscores.
        Credits.    
        Info.
    Difficulty select.
    Mission select.
    Level start.
    Level content.
    Level failed
    level succes.
    Game over.
    HighScore.

contains:

Missions and assets links defined in json files.
Loading missions.
Clean Javascript object destructs.
Modular Javascript with encapsulation.
Fixed screen dimensions and full screen responsive mode.
Audio.
Configuration.
Visual Debugger.

This project uses a project that I have created before, jsProject.
The project is contained in this repository so it can easily adapted to the projects needs.
jsProject contains some basic functionality like ajax calls, a debugger and some essentials for my projects.

To Do:

I am still working on the levels, 
only one level can be played,
 because the transition to the next level is not implemented.
It has become quite a complex project and I am setting out to simplify the project in this new version.
